# YATL

**Yet Another TOML Library** — A format-preserving TOML parser and editor written in C.

## Overview

YATL is designed with simplicity and reliability in mind:

- **Zero allocation** — No heap allocations required
- **Format-preserving** — Edits maintain your original formatting, comments, and whitespace
- **Simple API** — Clean, straightforward syntax for parsing and editing
- **Memory-safe by design** — Heavy use of stack and static memory, opaque types, and initialization detection to prevent common memory bugs
